## Factors Affecting Evidence Acquisition

- **Civil cases:** evidence acquired by issuing a request for production
    - Company responsibility to store and produce files, per the document retention order
- **Criminal cases:**
    - Requires strict adherence to Chain of Custody (ensure no tampering with evidence)
    - Use search warrants, subpoenas, etc.
- Civil cases can develop into criminal cases, and vice versa.


- **Digital Forensics cases:**
    - In a forensics lab, create forensic image (copies a device down to the smallest component) of device, and analyze image.
    - Can potentially find deleted files or file fragments (criminal cases only)


- Reduce Cost and Time
    - Narrow down scope (keywords, timeframe, specific files)
